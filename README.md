# orange_trees
Tree Based ML classification algorithms written in Rust. This repo includes implementations for Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees. This was a quick project to learn more about designing fast ML algorithms from scratch in Rust, as well as using this library in Python. 

## TODO 
- [ ] Create FFI from Rust to Python to use these algorithms in Python
- [ ] Create library crate on crates.io
